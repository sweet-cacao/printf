# ft_printf
The first task in algorythms

It is my implementation of function printf.

# Compiling
Makefile will compile the library libftprintf.a. After that you can use it in the same way as you used printf.

Don't forget to #include "includes/ft_printf.h"

Compile your file with L . libftprintf.a

Example: 
ft_printf("%d\n", 5);
5
